Automatically sync WooCommerce products & variations with a supplier CSV feed. Uses Action Scheduler for background updates. Adds a per-product/per-variation checkbox "Supplier Stocked" which, when enabled, causes the plugin to check the supplier CSV (hourly) and set product/variation to Backorder or Out of Stock when our stock is 0.
